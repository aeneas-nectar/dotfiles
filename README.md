My collection of Dotfiles and other config

## Install

On fresh installation of macOS:
```shell
xcode-select --install
```


Clone and install dotfiles:
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/awalkerca/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
$ cd ~/dotfiles
$ ./bin/dev #this runs the cli from source instead of a compiled version
```

built using oclif, there is a presumption of node and npm available.
Install manually.
